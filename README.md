Hi all!

 I have completed a movie app which is powered by TMDB API.

 This app is made fully using react and next.js.

 Features:
 1) See upcoming movies
 2) See GOAT movies
 3) See now playing movies
 4) Search through movies
 5) Add reviews and able to see all reviews by all users

 THis is my first time learning creating a next.js app! I was able to learn about:
 1) auth.js where i learned about nodemailer, protect routes using session cookies, credentials sign in and google sign in.
 2) api fetching from the TMDB API and then also from the database
 3) Used prisma as the ORM
 4) Used Vercel Postgresql as the database
 5) Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
 6) Responsive Design for the webpage

 I will continue to add more features and continue to learn more on React and nextJS!
