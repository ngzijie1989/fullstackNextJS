Hi all!

 I have completed a movie app titled MovieHunt! which is powered by TMDB API.

 This app is made fully using react and next.js.

 Features:
 1) See upcoming movies
 2) See GOAT movies
 3) See now playing movies
 4) Search movies through date filters and search handles
 5) See details of each movie 
 6) Add reviews and able to see all reviews by all users

 THis is my first time learning and creating a next.js app! I was able to learn about:
 1) Auth.js where i learned about nodemailer, protect routes using session cookies, credentials sign in and google sign in. I tweaked around with nextAuth.js as well (the older version of Auth.js) and watched quite a number of youtube videos and read the documentations to get a clear idea and picture of Auth.JS.
 2) API fetching from the TMDB API and then also from the database and backend server
 3) Used Prisma as the ORM
 4) Used Vercel Postgresql as the database
 5) Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
 6) Implemented loading and shimmering animation while loading during data fetching 
 7) Responsive Design for the webpage
 8) Link Up with Cloudinary for image storing.

 I will continue to add more features and continue to learn more on React and nextJS!
