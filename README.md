<h1 className="underline">Tech Stack</h1>

**nextJS**: nextJS is an excellent framework that integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, providing a streamlined and easy setup from the initial boilerplate. Server side actions help to reduce the hassle of going back and fro the server, and this reduces the time for development. Great!

**Prisma**: Prisma as the ORM relational mapping between MongoDB and my main application. Prisma is also good to add seed data and schema along with tables into my main App!

<h1 className="underline">Libraries i used and things I learnt</h1>
 1) Auth.js where i learned about nodemailer, protect routes using session cookies, credentials sign in and google sign in. 
 
 2) API fetching from the TMDB API and then also from the database and backend server
    
 3) Used Prisma as the ORM
    
 4) Used Vercel Postgresql as the database
    
 5) Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
    
 6) Implemented loading and shimmering animation while loading during data fetching
     
 7) Responsive Design for the webpage
     
 8) Link Up with Cloudinary for image storing.

Let me know your thoughts!
